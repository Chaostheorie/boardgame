# CSS sources

To utilize my layout with minimal effort while staying responsive and stylish (arguable) [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com) and [MDBootstrap (Material Design for Bootstrap](https://mdbootstrap.com) (MIT License) are as frontend frameworks in use. All dependencies (popper, jquery ...) are also in active use. For icons my choice was `font awesome` (free).

To not let `<select>` elements be left out [Bootstrap Select](https://github.com/snapappointments/bootstrap-select/) is used.
